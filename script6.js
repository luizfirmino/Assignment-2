/*
Part 6 - The “Coin Flip” Game Redux (5 points)
In this part of the assignment you will explore what you’ve learned so far about variables, for loops, conditionals,
operators, math, and more to create a different version of the “coin flip game”. To complete the game follow the steps outlined below:

1. Begin your application by declaring a variable called coinFlip. Do not assign the variable a number just yet.
*/

var coinFlip;

/*
2. Create a for loop that loops 10 times.
*/

var i;
for (i=0; i < 10; i++){

    /*
    3. Within the for loop assign a randomly generated number to coinFlip. You will have to use a Math method to get this number. Also, make sure to round that number off so that you get either a 0 or 1 as the result.
*/    
    coinFlip = Math.round(Math.random());
  
    /*
    4. Use a conditional to check the result of the coin flip. If it’s 0, write out “Heads” into the console window. If it’s 1, write out “Tails” into the console window.
    */
    
    if (coinFlip == 0)
        window.console.log("Heads");
    else
        window.console.log("Tails");
    
}
